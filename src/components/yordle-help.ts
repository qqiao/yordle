                <p>
                    Yordle allows you to shorten URLs so that they are easier
                    to share with people. For example, the following URL
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
                       target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
                    can be shortened to
                    <a href="/PmYUlTPea"
                       target="_blank">${document.baseURI}PmYUlTPea</a>,
                    which can be shared more easily.
                </p>
                <h4>How to I shorten a link?</h4>
                <p>
                    To shorten a link, paste in the long URL in the text box
                    labeled 'Your original URL here', then click on the
                    'Shorten URL' link.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A new dialog box will show up with the shortened URL. Click
                    on the 'Copy' button to copy it to your clipboard so that
                    it can be shared, emailed or tweeted.
                </p>
